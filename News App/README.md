### III. Loading News Tab

When you go to any tab (General, Health, Technology etc.), it takes some time to load, so for that time, a loader will be shown there.

### V. News Loading

If you click on the View button at the right side of each news, you will be shown a modal, where the news gets loaded. It takes some to load completely, so for that time, a loading icon can be seen there.
